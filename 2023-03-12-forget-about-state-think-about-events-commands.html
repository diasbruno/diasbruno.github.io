<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>When managing state, it's easy to just
think about which knobs you need
to change manually. This is a low-level view
of how state management works.</p>
<p>If the developer doesn't pay attention,
the number of small states increases
and also the work to keep everything in sync
(since there are additional states that needs
to be updated together).</p>
<p>There is only a finite number of commands
and transitions an application really needs.</p>
<p>We can imagine something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>route to some place</li>
<li>select an item from a list</li>
<li>submit a form to an endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>And translate into code as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class RouteTo implements Command {}
class SelectedItem implements Command {}
class SubmitForm implements Command {}
</code></pre>
<h3>The application state</h3>
<p>State, specially in most mainstream front-end
technologies, they are all just a union of
all possible states in an object available
at any time.</p>
<p>This also means that you are adding cache or,
at least, you need to set up and tear down,
and, always at risk of having stale data.</p>
<p>It also common to shard the state into modules
to separate one from another, but in some cases,
you need to run actions for each of the states,
causing many requests to render for a single event.</p>
<p>Instead, we can start using a state machine.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class ListingUsers implements State {}
class CreatingUser implements State {}
class EditingUser implements State {}
class ViewUser implements State {}
</code></pre>

<h3>Commands and state</h3>
<p>To get everything together, we can use a simple
reduce.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/**
 * Pattern matching objects by their contructor's
 * name.
 */
function match(object, table) {
  const name = object.constructor.name;
  return (table[name] || table['_'])(object);
}

/**
 * Given a state and many commands,
 * integrate each and accumulate
 * the next commands each command
 * can issue.
 */
function updateState(state, commands) {
  let nextState = { state, commands };
  do {
    const commands = nextState.commands;
    nextState.commands = [];
    nextState = commands.reduce(
      (currentState, command) =&gt; {
        const { state, commands } = currentState;
        const [s, cs] = command.apply(state);
        currentState.state = s;
        currentState.commands = commands.concat(cs);
        return currentState;
      },
      nextState
    );
  } while (nextState.commands.length != 0);
  return nextState.state;
}

class ListingUsers {}
class ViewingUser {}
class CreatingUser {}
class EditingUser {}

class SelectedUser {
  constructor(user) { this.user = user; }

  apply(state) {
    return match(state, {
      ListingUsers: (s) =&gt; [new ViewingUser(this.user), []],
      '_': () =&gt; {
        throw new Error('cannot select if not on ListingUser state.');
      }
    })
  }
}

class EditUser {
  constructor(user) { this.user = user; }

  apply(state) {
    return match(state, {
      ViewingUser: (s) =&gt; [new EditingUser(this.user), []],
      '_': () =&gt; {
        throw new Error('cannot edit if on ViewUser state.');
      }
    })
  }
}

class CreateUser {
  apply(state) {
    return match(state, {
      ListingUsers: (s) =&gt; [new CreatingUser({}), []],
      '_': () =&gt; {
         throw new Error('cannot create user if on ListingUser state.');
      }
    })
  }
}

let list = [{ user: 'me' }];
let state = new ListingUsers(list);

// start at this state
state = new ListingUsers(list);

// transitioned to ViewingUser
state = updateState(state, [new SelectedUser(list[0])]);

// throws because ViewingUser
// can't handle SelectedUser event
state = updateState(state, [new SelectedUser(list[0])]);
</code></pre>
<p>This is great! We can now test it separate without having
to setup anything related to the library or framework
or whatever.</p>
<p>Also, if we use property-based testing, we can generate
as many events as we can to test &quot;infinity&quot; scenarios.</p>
<p>The application state becomes just a lot of commands
applied to an initial state.</p>
<p>It simplifies a lot because:</p>
<ul>
<li>everything is updated in a single pass</li>
<li>user can issue as many commands as they want (still a single pass)</li>
<li>most of the things are in a central place</li>
<li>state transitions are clear</li>
<li>this can be used to create feature/local state to control
inner components on a use case</li>
<li>it's also FRP-like (functional reactive programming)</li>
</ul>
<p>And this idea comes from way back:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional reactive animation - Paul Hudak, Conal Elliott, 1997</li>
<li>Event-Driven FRP - Zhanyong Wan, Walid Taha &amp; Paul Hudak, 2001</li>
<li>Arrows, Robots, and Functional Reactive Programming - Paul Hudak, Antony Courtney, Henrik Nilsson, and John Peterson, 2002</li>
</ul>
<p>On applications, this is a very simple separation of concerns
that may help you develop large scale apps.</p>
