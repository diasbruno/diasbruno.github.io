<p>Favorite last words:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;The feature is fully tested. EVERY POSSIBLE CASE!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>It's very hard to think about every possible test case
for a feature.</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">describe 'filling the bucket' do
  it 'should not overflow' do
    # args are (capacity, quantity)
    b = described_class.filled(2, 0)
    c = Cup.filled(2, 2)

    expect(b.fill(c).quantity).to be &lt;= b.capacity
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>And you ask...</p>
<pre><code>What can go wrong?
</code></pre>
<p>Problem is that we know how to write
the easy solutions.</p>
<p>What would happen if we change the capacity and quantity
to be random numbers?</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">describe 'filling the bucket' do
  it 'should not overflow' do
    # args are (capacity, quantity)
    b = described_class.filled(rand, rand)
    c = Cup.filled(rand, rand)

    expect(b.fill(c).quantity).to be &lt;= b.capacity
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Eventually it fails. One of the possibilities
is that the <code>Cup</code> can be larger than the <code>Bucket</code>,
so it will overflow.</p>
<p>So, let's improve the test by checking some properties
about the problem.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">describe 'filling the bucket' do
  it 'should not overflow' do
    b = Bucket.filled(rand, rand)
    c = Cup.filled(rand, rand)

    # if the cup is not empty, bucket must not be full...
    # there is the case where the cup is empty
    if c.quantity &gt; 0
        expect(b.quantity).to be &lt; b.capacity
    else
        expect(b.quantity).to be &lt;= b.capacity
    end
    # cup must not overflow
    expect(c.quantity).to be &lt;= c.capacity
    # filling the bucket must not overflow
    expect(b.fill(c).quantity).to be &lt;= b.capacity
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we understand a little bit more
about the problem.</p>
<p>It will fail randomly on one of the assertions and
part of the problem is that there is no validation
when we construct both objects like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>capacity</code> and <code>quantity</code> can be negative</li>
<li><code>quantity</code> can be greater that the <code>capacity</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So, let's introduce a validation of the inputs
for the <code>Recipient</code> class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb"># both classes extends this one
class Recipient
  def self.validate(capacity, quantity)
    assert(capacity &gt; 0, CAPACITY_GREATER_THAN_ZERO)
    assert(quantity &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; quantity &lt;= capacity, QUATITY_BETWEEN_ZERO_AND_CAPACITY)

    true
  end

  def self.filled(capacity, quantity)
    validate(capacity, quantity)
    new(capacity, quantity)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now we know that we can only instantiate a valid recipient...
time to write some tests for the <code>Recipient</code> class, but instead
of thinking on the valid cases, we are going to stress out
the failing cases.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">describe 'instantiate' do
  it 'must fail for every case' do
    # we create a pair of integers (capacity, quantity)
    # and they have a special property...
    # if the test fails, this kind of test
    # knows how to &quot;shrink&quot; the result
    # to find the smallest possible failing case.
    # by default it will run 100 times with different
    # values.
    p = property_of { [integer, integer] }
    p.check do |opts|
      capacity, quantity = opts
      expect {
        Recipient.filled(capacity, quantity)
      }.to raise_error(StandardError)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is how you can write a property-based test. But it's
not done yet.</p>
<p>Every pair of values must be invalid in this case and, if we
got it right, we don't need to write the valid cases.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">describe 'instantiate' do
  it 'must fail for every case' do
    p = property_of do
      capacity = integer
      quantity = integer

      # preconditions to be create an invalid recipient
      guard(capacity &lt; 0 || quantity &lt; 0 || quantity &gt; capacity)

      [capacity, quantity]
    end
    p.check do |opts|
      capacity, quantity = opts
      expect {
        Recipient.filled(capacity, quantity)
      }.to raise_error(StandardError)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can be confident that we have cover a lot of spots when
instantiating any subclass of Recipient. If we want, we can
use <code>.check(t)</code>, where <code>t</code> is how many tests we want, to stress
even further.</p>
<p>We can now go back to the broken test and try to fix it.</p>
<p>So, it should be possible to instantiate a Bucket
and many Cups as we want and it should always end up
on our goal state (the bucket been full).</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could implement &quot;shrink&quot;
on our classes so we could write the test like this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">it 'should not overflow' do
  p = property_of do
    b = bucket
    cs = array { cup }
    [b, cs]
  end

  p.check do |opts|
    bucket, cups = opts

    cups.reduce(bucket) do |b, cup|
      b.fill(cup)
    end

    expect(b.quantity).to be &lt;= b.capacity
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>To implement &quot;shrink&quot; for our classes, they must implement
2 methods (<code>shrinkable?</code> and <code>shrink</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">module RecipientShrinkable
  def shrink
    copy = new(@capacity, @quantity)
    copy.capacity.shrink if @capacity.shrinkable?
    copy.quantity.shrink if @quantity.shrinkable?
    copy
  end

  def shrinkable?
    @capacity.shrinkable? || @quantity.shrinkable?
  end
end

class BucketGen &lt; Bucket
  include RecipientShrinkable
end

class CupGen &lt; Cup
  include RecipientShrinkable
end

# creates the data to create a valid recipient
def valid_recipient
  capacity = range(1, 10)
  guard(capacity &gt; 0)
  quantity = range(0, capacity)
  [capacity, quantity]
end

# always creates a valid bucket
def bucket
  BucketGen.filled(*valid_recipient)
end

# always creates a valid cup
def cup
  CupGen.filled(*valid_recipient)
end
</code></pre>
<p>With this, we have a small DSL (domain specific language)
to write our tests.</p>
<p>Our previous test, will also fails, because we can have
a cup larger that the bucket, maybe there are more cups than
what the bucket can handle...so we need to improve the preconditions
of our test.</p>
<p>First, let's make the precondition for just a single cup.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">it 'should not overflow' do
  p = property_of do
    b = bucket
    c = cup

    # only test if it won't overflow
    # we are interest on the possibilities of state
    # of the bucket and cup
    guard((c.quantity + b.quantity) &lt;= b.capacity)

    [b, c]
  end

  p.check(1000) do |opts|
    b, c = opts

    b.fill(c)

    # we expect in this case that the bucket
    # maybe full or not.
    expect(b.quantity).to be &lt;= b.capacity
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now, for any number of cups...</p>
<pre><code class="language-rb">it 'should not overflow' do
  p = property_of do
    b = bucket
    cs = array(20) { cup }

    # check if all the cups can overflow the bucket
    # and reject the ones that cause the overflow.
    #
    # we have the case b.quantity == b.capacity
    # in this case we are going to have no cups (empty list)
    cs, _, check = cs.reduce([[], b.capacity, b.quantity]) do |acc, cup|
      cs, max, quantity = acc

      q = quantity + cup.quantity

      if q &lt;= max
        cs.push(cup)
      else
        q = quantity
      end

      [cs, max, q]
    end

    # if there is still space on the bucket
    # we create a new cup to precisily fill it
    # so we reach the goal state.
    if check &lt; b.capacity
      remainder = b.capacity - check
      c = CupGen.filled(remainder, remainder)
      cs.push(c)
    end

    [b, cs]
  end

  p.check do |opts|
    b, cs = opts

    cs.reduce(b) do |b, c|
      b.fill(c)
    end

    expect(b.full?).to be(true)
  end
end
</code></pre>
