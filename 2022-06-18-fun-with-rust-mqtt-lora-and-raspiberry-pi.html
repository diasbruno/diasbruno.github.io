<p>Recently, I was called to give a hand on a small project for fun.
It was about tracking groups of people using GPS.</p>
<p>The project was nice and all, problem was trying to get the correct,
and simplier, tools for the project.</p>
<p>We found a company that helped us with the hardware stuff
and they provide us with some sensors (Dragino LGT-92)
and a gateway (Dragino LIG-16). They talk to each other using
radio.</p>
<p>The LIG-16 is a gateway that provides a lot of stuff
and we used its MQTT client to communicate with our broker
(since there was no connection at the location where it was used).</p>
<p>The first idea we tried was to have everything inside a iPhone,
but unfortunately we did not found an easy MQTT broker to use internally
with the app.</p>
<p>Than, we accepted we need to add an extra device to handle the application.
So, we added a Raspiberry PI 4 where we could run the MQTT broker and
provide a REST api to be consumed on a offline map on the phone.</p>
<p>This is the application we build:</p>

<p>I wrote a rust application that with <a href="https://github.com/bytebeamio/rumqtt">rumqtt</a> that provided
the borker and client for the MQTT and <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">warp</a> for the web server,
and <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">sqlx</a> for the database (no need to orm or anything like,
all queries were simple).</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Add images &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>To help with some message decoding I wrote a small library
<a href="https://github.com/diasbruno/rust_dragino_lgt92_tools">rust_dragino_lgt92_tools</a></p>
