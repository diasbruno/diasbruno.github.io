<p>I love <a href="https://github.com/comby-tools/comby">Comby</a>, in their words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A tool for structural code search and replace
that supports ~every language.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the time when I'm reviewing some pull request,
I always have the same thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I've seem this before...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I see a pattern here...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>And then I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the project folder.</li>
<li>Update the repository.</li>
<li>Go to the PR's branch.</li>
<li>Figure out a <code>grep</code> that can extract what I want.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we all know, step 4 is the one that takes a lot of time.</p>
<p><code>comby</code> understands a little bit of syntax and deals well
balancing <code>()</code>, <code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code>,
which is the most painful thing to do when writing regex.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>After some interactions on our software, we had many methods related to permissions written on views
and components. Eventually, things starts getting duplicated, so it was time to refactor/reorganize.</p>
<p>Using comby, this was basically (or close) of what I had to type:</p>
<pre><code>comby 'can:[~[A-Za-z0-9_]*](:[h]) {:[i]}' '' -matcher .js
</code></pre>
<p>Output example:</p>
<pre><code>------ file.vue
++++++ file.vue
@|-1,5 +1,3 ============================================================
 |  computed: {
!|     canEdit() {
!|       return this.user.permissions.contains(Permissions.X);
!|     }
 |  }
</code></pre>
<p>This expression highlights every function/method
that is prefixed with 'can' (<code>:[h]</code> and <code>:[I]</code>
are just placeholders saying &quot;whatever is in between
the parenthesis and curly brackets&quot;).</p>
<p>With the result in hand, I show to the team, we discussed
when we could tackle this issue, we had some ideas
and we start the refactor.</p>
<p>This is one use case of comby, go checkout their page
and I hope this will be your favorite tool as it's mine now.</p>
