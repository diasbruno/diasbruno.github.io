<p>we all get excited when we see an interesting trick.</p>
<p>some are &quot;one-liners&quot;, or an exotic optimization...</p>
<p>but everytime there is something that looks convenient,
it will probably collect your soul later...</p>
<p>some people don't like when their files starts with a
huge list of imports. I can agree that is not that aesthetic.</p>
<p>to avoid huge lists of imports, we can use a file to reexport
all the modules into a single entry.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {
    a,
    b,
    c,
    d,
    e,
    f,
    g,
    h,
    i,
    j,
    k,
    l,
    m,
    n,
    o,
    p,
    q,
    r,
    s,
    t,
    u,
    v,
    x,
    z }
    from &quot;@/components&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>well...that doesn't look good either.</p>
<p>here is a list of problems you may found when reexporting
modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>circular dependencies</li>
<li>loading more resource than necessary</li>
<li>import modules that instantiate objects on top-level</li>
<li>test pollution and unnecessary mocking</li>
</ul>
<h3>circular dependencies</h3>
<p>If you have a file that exports everything,
you better use it!</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Component A

import { B, C } from &quot;@/components&quot;;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Component C
import { A } from &quot;@/components&quot;;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Components (syntax of this file is not important...)

/* correct import order */
export { default as C } from &quot;./ComponentC&quot;;
export { default as B } from &quot;./ComponentB&quot;;
export { default as A } from &quot;./ComponentA&quot;;

/* incorrect import order */
export { default as A } from &quot;./ComponentA&quot;;
export { default as B } from &quot;./ComponentB&quot;;
export { default as C } from &quot;./ComponentC&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>depending on the order of the imports,
you may not see the problem...</p>
<p>but when it's wrong, you will probably spend hours trying
to remember what is going on.</p>
<p>some will say that a simple solution to fix this is that
&quot;components should not use the file that reexports everything&quot;,
or basically getting back from where we started.</p>
<p>this is the first rule we need to make the entire team to follow
just to have a single file.</p>
<h3>loading more resource than necessary</h3>
<p>getting the tools to properly do a &quot;tree-shake&quot;
or to better bundle the application is the last thing
I want to spend time.</p>
<p>this makes it harder for the compiler to decide what to do.
so we are starting to introduce problems to create tools
(we don't need), just to have a file to group modules.</p>
<h3>import modules that instantiate objects on top-level</h3>
<p>once you import a module, if it evaluates an expressions on the top-level,
this work can be unncessary an slow down specially tests.</p>
<p>it is almost impossible to mock or to avoid running the code,
or, you will end up writing a lot of unnecessary code
to &quot;skip this code when testing&quot;.</p>
<h3>test pollution and unnecessary mocking</h3>
<p>as you may have modules that instantiates objects on the top-level,
they are kinda unpredictable or you may know, and now, you have
to create a general mocking file that every test must import.</p>
<p>this creates all sorts of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>people assuming the mock has &quot;correct&quot; data</li>
<li>incomplete use cases testing because &quot;it just works&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>so, just because of this trick, we are risking to introduce
a lot of unnecessary code and all kinds of problems...</p>
<p>this doesn't look like a good idea...</p>
