Every process requires a definition of what is its outcome.</p>
<p>One way we can categorize the outcome of a process is to define
what is <code>success</code> and <code>failure</code> of it. Both cases, means that
we have finished our job and the outcome could be a success
and we can get a product/artifact out of it, or, we fail with
a reason, so we can understand what happened and take action.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we have to deal with things
that goes out of our control which makes
impossible to continue the process
and we just exit the process: the <code>exceptions</code>.</p>
<p>We can choose any form to model our understand
of the outcome of process, it's only recommended that you
follow one of them, so the codebase don't get messy.
Generally, it looks like one of these:</p>

<p>We are going to walk through all those styles,
both in object-oriented programming
and functional programming, using a simple example.</p>
<p>Our example (of course, we are not going to implement everything. So, an execise for the reader):</p>

<p>Please, give me an example of a domain, using domain-driven design, of a account creation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ChatGPT]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly! Let's consider a domain scenario
for account creation in the context of an online banking system
using Domain-Driven Design (DDD).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Bounded Contexts:</h3>
<p>In DDD, we often start by defining bounded contexts.
For our online banking system, we might have different bounded contexts
such as <em>Identity and Access Management</em> and <em>Customer Relationship Management</em>.</p>
<h3>Entities:</h3>
<h4><em>User</em>:</h4>
<p>Represents an individual who interacts with the system.
Properties: UserId, Username, Password, Email, Role, etc.</p>
<h4>Customer:</h4>
<p>Represents a customer of the bank.
Properties: CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Address, ContactNumber, etc.</p>
<h3>Aggregates:</h3>
<h4>AccountCreationRequest:</h4>
<p>An aggregate representing a request to create a new account.
Properties: RequestId, CustomerInfo, Username, Password, AuthorizationToken, etc.</p>
<h3>Value Objects:</h3>
<h4>CustomerInfo:</h4>
<p>A value object containing essential information about the customer required for account creation.
Properties: FirstName, LastName, Email, Address, ContactNumber, etc.</p>
<h3>Repositories:</h3>
<h4>UserRepository:</h4>
<p>Manages the persistence and retrieval of user information.</p>
<h4>CustomerRepository:</h4>
<p>Manages the persistence and retrieval of customer information.</p>
<h3>Services:</h3>
<h4>AccountCreationService:</h4>
<p>Coordinates the process of account creation.
Receives a request, validates the provided information, creates a new user,
associates the user with a customer, and sets up initial account details.</p>
<h3>Domain Events:</h3>
<h4>AccountCreatedEvent:</h4>
<p>Published when an account creation is successful.
Subscribers to this event might include modules responsible for sending welcome emails,
initializing default settings, etc.</p>
<h3>Policies:</h3>
<h4>PasswordPolicy:</h4>
<p>Enforces rules regarding password strength and complexity.</p>
<h3>Domain Services:</h3>
<h4>NotificationService:</h4>
<p>Responsible for notifying the customer about the successful account creation, e.g., sending a welcome email.</p>
<h3>Factories:</h3>
<h4>AccountFactory:</h4>
<p>Responsible for creating instances of the User entity and setting up initial properties.</p>
<h3>Aggregates and Relationships:</h3>
<p>An AccountCreationRequest aggregate may include a reference to the CustomerInfo value object, a Username, a Password, and other relevant data.
The AccountCreationService orchestrates the creation of the user and the association with the customer.
This is a simplified representation, and the actual design would depend on the specific requirements and complexities of the system. Domain-Driven Design emphasizes close collaboration between domain experts and developers to create a shared understanding of the problem domain and to design a system that reflects that understanding.

<blockquote>
<p>Give me some domain errors for exceptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ChatGPT]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly! In a domain-driven design, it's essential to model domain-specific errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of business logic. Here are some examples of domain errors related to account creation in an online banking system:</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>DuplicateUsernameError:</h4>
<p>This error occurs when a user attempts to create an account with a username that already exists in the system.</p>
<h4>WeakPasswordError:</h4>
<p>Raised when the password provided during account creation does not meet the required strength and complexity criteria specified by the password policy.</p>
<h4>InvalidCustomerInfoError:</h4>
<p>Indicates that the customer information provided for account creation is invalid or incomplete.</p>
<h4>UserCreationFailedError:</h4>
<p>If there are issues during the creation of the user entity, such as database connection problems or other persistence-related errors.</p>
