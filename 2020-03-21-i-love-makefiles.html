<p>Why aren't we using old stuff?
Is it just because it is...old?</p>
<p><code>make</code> is great and we should use it more!</p>
<p>We are not going to talk in details about
<code>make</code> (there are a lot of good articles
to read already), but to encorage
its adoption to help make our lives easier.</p>
<p>Let me give you a scenario...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd a_project
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>Did we just build and installed on our system
a <code>python</code> project? Or it was a <code>javascript</code> one?
Maybe it was a <code>C++</code> project that uses <code>CMake</code>...</p>
<p>This is <code>make</code>'s specialty...to execute tasks!</p>
<p>What are the benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, we don't need to remember those long commands (<code>make docker-run</code>)</li>
<li>Anyone can build, install and run the project</li>
<li>You can use it to write an entire pipeline to generate
changelogs, update versions, tagging,
without knowing which tools it uses under the hood.</li>
</ul>
